    <string name="rulesText">There is no ruling on how to choose the shooter. Whoever arrives first is allowed to shoot. Players can rotate the position, take turns or select a volunteer.
                             \n\nThe shooter will select the betting amount they want to wager and choose between two betting options: Pass or Don’t Pass.
                            \n\nBefore the shooter rolls a seven, they will throw the target number if they opted for the Pass bet.
                            \n\nIt’s up to the shooter to offer odds during the game.
                            \n\nThis method will continue after the players have placed their bets on the options that are opposite to the shooter’s bet.
                            \n\nThe shooter can reduce the betting amount if the wagers can’t cover the initial bet that they selected.
                            \n\nIn Street Craps, players can also make side bets.
                            \n\nAfter the shooter throws the dice, all bet placing must stop.
                            \n\nAll Passes get a win if the result of the dice roll is seven or eleven.
                            \n\nDon’t Pass bets will win if the results are two, three, or twenty.</string>
